## INTRODUCTION
  - Consider a sequence of n trees { T0, T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn }. From T0, a monkey can swing to the next adjacent tree (T1). 
  - It can also swing to other succeeding trees (T2 or T3 or ...) provided that the trees in the middle are shorter than both T0 and the target tree. 
  - Suppose that tree heights = 10, 15, and 20 feet. The following are possible pairs of trees that the monkey can swing
  
## REQUIREMENTS
# 1. The program must at least
    - Get number of trees (at least 3) and the height of each tree from user
    - Given the tree arrangement in (1.1), report all possible tree-pairs and the total number of pairs
  
# 2. Design a better user interface
  - Good user interface doesn’t mean fancy output, but rather how your program is easy to understand & to use even without user manual.

# 3. Data Structure
  - There are many approaches to solving this problem. Using brute force (i.e. checking all possible pairs of trees) is one of them. But you should research and implement a better solution.
  - My soltution using #STACK

# 4. Algorithm
  - How do you check & keep a valid tree-pair and move on to the next pair ?
  - How do you skip invalid tree-pairs ?
  - Demonstrate how your algorithm works step-by-step until all pairs are found, using the example
of 5 trees (19, 17, 15, 20, 20 ft)
    
# 5. Exception handling
  - For example, don’t give a limitation that your program will crash if the tree height is negative just because you are too lazy to check for valid input
