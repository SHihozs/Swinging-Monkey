## INTRODUCTION
   Consider a sequence of n trees { T0, T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn }. From T0, a monkey can swing to the next adjacent tree (T1). It can also swing to other succeeding trees (T2 or T3 or ...) provided that the trees in the middle are shorter than both T0 and the target tree. Suppose that tree heights = 10, 15, and 20 feet. The following are possible pairs of trees that the monkey can swing
  
## REQUIREMENTS
# 1. The program must at least
    1.1 Get the number of trees (at least 3) and the height of each tree from the user
    1.2 Given the tree arrangement in (1.1), report all possible tree pairs and the total number of pairs
  
# 2. Design a better user interface
    2.1 Good user interface doesn’t mean fancy output, but rather how your program is easy to understand & to use even without a user manual.

# 3. Data Structure
    3.1 There are many approaches to solving this problem. Using brute force (i.e. checking all possible pairs of trees) is one of them. But you should research and implement a better solution.
    3.2 My solution using #STACK

# 4. Algorithm
    4.1 How do you check & keep a valid tree pair and move on to the next pair?
    4.2 How do you skip invalid tree-pairs?
    4.3 Demonstrate how your algorithm works step-by-step until all pairs are found, using the example of 5 trees (19, 17, 15, 20, 20 ft)
    
# 5. Exception handling
    5.1 For example, don’t give a limitation that your program will crash if the tree height is negative just because you are too lazy to check for valid input
